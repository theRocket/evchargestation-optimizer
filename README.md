# EV Charge Station Optimizer

## Purpose

This project uses machine learning optimization techniques and the Google Maps API to find the ideal location for new electric vehicle charging infrastructure.

## Data Sources
Starting data points come from several sources:

### Origins

The first task is to select the starting point from which to target a new nearest station.

#### [AAA EVs Out of Charge data](https://autoinsights.aaa.biz/products/evs-out-of-charge)
This data was selected first, specifically targeting places where their customers have had to call for assistance due to an out-of-charge incident.


#### [EVRI eRoadMap](https://eroadmap.epri.com/)

An interactive map showing where electricity infrastructure is needed to accomodate full electrification of all vehicles by 2030.

This data was selected second since it has already been vetted for EV infrastructure needs in the long-term, and EV infrastructure is a long-term investment.

According to their [FAQ](https://eroadmap.epri.com/docs/eRoadMAP_FAQs_F_11172023.pdf):

> Through a collaborative, anonymous, secure, and transparent process, EPRI worked with a number of analytical partners and data providers to collect both publicly available
and proprietary data - such as vehicle registrations, trip data and driving patterns, vehicle efficiencies, electrification plans, and state and federal policy. This data was used in
combination with projected EV adoption in different areas of the country to develop the eRoadMAP estimates.

> This tool reflects a combination of both high-confidence data sources and simulations of expected adoption. As EPRI gathers more and more data, the confidence in the
energy estimates at each hexagon will rise. It should also be noted that generally as one zooms in to smaller and smaller hexagons, the certainty will decrease as the data is
reliant on the behavior of fewer vehicles rather than an aggregated number"

### Finding Destinations

#### Google Maps [Places](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/?apix=true) and [Routes](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/routes) APIs

This API is used to route from an origin above to a nearest station and find the total driving distance via the best route (not linear distance or "as the crow flies"). If there is not one within 5-20 kilometers (parameter to be tuned), then one will be generated by the ML optimization routine.

### Validation

#### [U.S. Dept of Energy Alternative Fuels Data Center](https://developer.nrel.gov/docs/transportation/alt-fuel-stations-v1/nearest/)

The AFDC has an [interactive map](https://afdc.energy.gov/fuels/electricity_locations.html#/find/route?fuel=ELEC&start=wenatchee,%20wa&end=spokane,%20wa) showing nearest stations along a route. This is also available via API so it can be referenced as a test validation for the results found above via Google Maps API.

## Getting Started

#### Installation of Python Packages

Uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/basic-usage/) for dependency management. See a good write-up to justify why I chose this on [Medium here](https://pub.towardsai.net/forget-pip-conda-requirements-txt-use-poetry-instead-and-thank-me-later-226a0bc38a56).

Then you can run a sample script to fetch some places like so:
```python
poetry run python place_fetch.py
```
